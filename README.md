<h3 align='center'>Blockchain Based Decentralized Voting System</h3>

---

### Overview :
In this project, a security mechanism based on blockchain technology has been designed to be integrated with the EVMs in order to maintain the integrity of votes in the election process. Suitable modifications to the original implementation of the blockchain by Satoshi Nakamoto has been suggested to suit the requirements of a voting system. Since the proposed design makes use of a decentralized network, when any malicious change is made to the votes stored in the blockchain then the chain tampering is noticed and the tampered block is replaced with the correct one from another randomly chosen node in the next mining cycle thus protecting the data from modifications. In order to successfully modify the data stored in the blockchain, the change needs to be reflected at the data stored in all the nodes in the network. Along with this, the data stored in all the subsequent blocks at all the nodes will also have to be changed to maintain the cryptographic link between all the blocks. In this way our model can ensure the integrity of the votes at all times.

### Motivation : 
The success of any democracy depends on the fairness of its elections. Building a secure voting system that maintains secrecy of votes while still providing transparency to the voters has been a challenge for a very long time.The recent rise in malpractices such as EVM tampering and booth capturing has raised questions regarding the integrity of the election process. This has forced the authorities to look for new secure ways to conduct elections. We propose a novel peer to peer system based on Blockchain in order to process and store the EVM transactions. The proposed model also tries to address various problems of the current system.
